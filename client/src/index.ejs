<h1>Hi</h1>
<p>
    I am a full-stack web developer. I was the tech lead on School Cuts, among other things, when I worked for
    Outlandish co-operative. Before that, I was taught how to write good back-end code by Daniel of Twickets, and good
    front-end code by Davy McGeorge.
</p>
<p>
    I take on pro-bono work, at-cost work, and commercial work - all at different rates - but I won't cost more than
    Â£200/day. As a communist, this still seems like too much, but I've been told that people won't take me seriously
    if I go any lower.

    This site is a weird, probably useless, implementation of a static site generator. I knocked it up on 1st August
    2018, for fun. Pros: the data is stored in a database, which I think is a better way to store data than in static
    files. Cons: all the cons of having to set up a database. Also, as with all SSGs, it only works if the source
    files follow a specific pattern. The code can be found on GitHub.
