        <h1>Hi</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a full-stack web developer. I was the tech lead on <a href="https://schoolcuts.org.uk">School Cuts</a>
            (among other things) when I worked for <a href="https://outlandish.com">Outlandish co-operative</a>, and
            most of my professional development occurred there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before that, I was taught how to write good back-end code by Daniel of
            <a href="https://twickets.co.uk">Twickets</a>, and good front-end code by
            <a href="http://davymacca.com/">Davy McGeorge</a>.
        </p>

<p>
    I take on pro-bono work, at-cost work, and commercial work - all at different rates - but I won't cost more than
    Â£200/day. As a communist, this still seems like too much, but I've been told that people won't take me seriously
    if I go any lower.

    This site is a weird, probably useless, implementation of a static site generator. I knocked it up on 1st August
    2018 for fun. When you submit the form below, the whole website is recompiled into a series of static HTML, JS and
    CSS files.
</p>
<p>
    Pros: the data is stored in a database, which I think is a better way to store data than in static
    files.
</p>
<p>
    Cons: all the cons of having to set up a database. Also, as with all SSGs, it only works if the source
    files follow a specific pattern. The code can be found on GitHub.
